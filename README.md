# Adversarial Neural Cryptography in [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)

A Tensorflow Flow implementation of Google Brain's recent paper ([Learning to Protect Communications with Adversarial Neural Cryptography.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.06918v1.pdf))

Two Neural Networks, Alice and Bob learn to communicate secretly with each other, in presence of an adversary Eve.

## Pre-requisites

* TensorFlow 
* Seaborn (for plots)
* Numpy

## Usage 
First, ensure you have the dependencies installed.
